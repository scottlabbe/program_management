# Database Field Reference

All tables live inside `extract_data/cost_reports.db`. The schema was generated by the Codex workflow that ingests cost report spreadsheets and normalizes them into SQLite tables. The sample values below are real rows from the bundled synthetic data so you can see the expected shapes and formats.

## `cost_reports`
Employee-level salary detail extracted from each report. Each row represents one person in one district/year combination.
